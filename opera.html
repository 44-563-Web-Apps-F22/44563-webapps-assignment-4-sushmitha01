    <h6 class="All">ALL:</h6>      
    <p class="spch">Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
    Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
    And, to make us more than merry
    Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>

    <h6 class="SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h6>   
    <p class="spch">For today our pirate 'prentice
    Rises from indentures freed;
    Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
    He's a pirate now indeed!</p>

    <h6 class="All">ALL:</h6>      
    <p class="spch">Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
    Fred'ric's out of his indentures.</p>

    <h6 class="SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h6>   
    <p class="spch">Two and twenty, now he's rising,
    And alone he's fit to fly,
    Which we're bent on signalizing
    With unusual revelry.</p>

    <h6 class="All">ALL:</h6>      
    <p class="spch">Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
    Fred'ric's out of his indentures.
    Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
    Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
    And, to make us more than merry
    Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>

    <h4><i>Song</i></h4>
    <h6 class="RUTH">RUTH:</h6>     
    <p class="sng">When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
    daring,
    His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
    seafaring.
    I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
    To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
    pilot â€”
    A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
    high lot,
    Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
    boy a pilot.</p>
