    <div class="b">
    <p> How tiresome!  Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor
        is a blind gentleman.  And the band who were to have had the
        honour of escorting us?  I see no band! </p> <br>
    </div>
    <h6> LUIZ:</h6>  
    <div class="b">
    <p>Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required
        to be paid in advance. </p>   <br> </div>
    <h6>DUCH:</h6>
    <div class="b">
    <p> That's so like a band!  </p> <br> </div>
    <h6> DUKE</h6><p>(annoyed). </p>
    <div class="b">
    <p> Insuperable difficulties meet me at every
        turn! </p> </div>   <br>
    <h6>DUCH :</h6>
    <div class="b">
    <p>But surely they know His Grace?  </p><br> </div>
    
    <h6>LUIZ:</h6>
    <div class="b"><p> Exactly—they know His Grace. </p></div>    <br>
    
    <h6>DUKE :</h6>
    <div class="b">
    <p> Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf
        gentleman.  A cornet-a-piston would be something.  You do not
        happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a
        cornet-a-piston?   </p> </div> <br>
    <h6>LUIZ:</h6>
    <div class="b">
    <p>  Alas, no, Your Grace!  But I can imitate a farmyard.</p></div> <br>
    <h6>DUKE </h6><p>(doubtfully)</p> 
    <div class="b">
    <p> I don't see how that would help us.  I 
        don't see how we could bring it in. </p> <br> </div>
    <h6>CAS : </h6>
    <div class="b">
    <p>It would not help us in the least.  We are not a 
        parcel of graziers come to market, dolt! </p></div><br> <p>(Luiz rises.)</p>
    <h6>DUKE :</h6>
    <div class="b">
      <p> My love, our suite's feelings!  <p>(To Luiz.) </p></div>  Be so good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro—

    <p> And suite   </p></div> <br>

    <h6>LUIZ :</h6><div class="b"><p> Your Grace has but to command. </p></div><br>
    <h6>DUKE </h6><div class="b"><p>(much moved)</p> <p>I felt sure of it—I felt sure of it!
        <p>(Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)</p> And now, my love— <p>(aside to
        Duchess) </p> Shall we tell her?  I think so— <p> (aloud to Casilda) </p> And
        now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise.  It is my
        agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you
        the happiest young lady in Venice! </p></div><br>
