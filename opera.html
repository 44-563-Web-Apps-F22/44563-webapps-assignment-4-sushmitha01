    DUKE.  How tiresome!  Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor
        is a blind gentleman.  And the band who were to have had the
        honour of escorting us?  I see no band!  <br>
    LUIZ.  Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required
        to be paid in advance.   <br>
    DUCH.  That's so like a band!   <br>
    DUKE (annoyed).  Insuperable difficulties meet me at every
        turn!      <br>
    DUCH.  But surely they know His Grace?  <br>
    LUIZ.  Exactly—they know His Grace.     <br>
    DUKE.  Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf
        gentleman.  A cornet-a-piston would be something.  You do not
        happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a
        cornet-a-piston?     <br>
    LUIZ.  Alas, no, Your Grace!  But I can imitate a farmyard. <br>
    DUKE (doubtfully).  I don't see how that would help us.  I 
        don't see how we could bring it in.  <br>
    CAS.  It would not help us in the least.  We are not a <br>
        parcel of graziers come to market, dolt!
                                                                    (Luiz
        rises.)
    DUKE.  My love, our suite's feelings!  (To Luiz.)  Be so  <br>
        good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his
        Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro—
    DUCH.  And suite—   <br>
    DUKE.  And suite—have arrived at Venice, and seek—  <br>
    CAS.  Desire—  <br>
    DUCH.  Demand!   <br>
    DUKE.  And demand an audience.  <br>
    LUIZ.  Your Grace has but to command.  <br>
    DUKE (much moved).  I felt sure of it—I felt sure of it!
        (Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)  And now, my love—(aside to
        Duchess)  Shall we tell her?  I think so—(aloud to Casilda)  And
        now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise.  It is my
        agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you
        the happiest young lady in Venice!<br>
